WP Theme Skeleton
===

This is a theme meant for hacking so don't use it as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning it into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what it's here for.

Here are some of the interesting things you'll find here:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* The main pages and templates that you should override, you are not supposed to use the same HTML used, but instead to use the functions and the methodology in your website that you are creating
* Helpful functions.php and lib folder containing main functionalities that most theme need

Getting Started
---------------

Download `WP Theme Skeleton` from here. The first thing you want to do is copy the `WP Theme Skeleton` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `myawesometheme`), and then you'll need to do a find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for: `toreplace` and replace with: `myawesometheme`
2. Add your css and js from the frontend already developed website, and enqueue them in `lib/functions-enqueue.php`
3. Replace `screenshot.png` with a screenshot from the design of the website you are creating, you need to keep same name and same size 1200x900

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
